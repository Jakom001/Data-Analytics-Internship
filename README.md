## Introduction

The [KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/theme/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship) is a comprehensive program designed to give participants a taste of working on data analytics projects within the context of a professional setting. Through a series of tasks and projects, I was able to apply my analytical and problem-solving skills to real-world business scenarios.



## Projects
During the internship, I successfully completed the following projects:

1. [**Data Quality Assessment:**](https://github.com/Jakom001/Data-Analytics-Internship/tree/main/Task%201%20%20-%20Data%20Quality%20Assessment) In this project, I assessed the quality of data in terms of accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability. I cleaned and preprocessed the data to prepare it for further analysis.

2. [**Data Insights:**](https://github.com/Jakom001/Data-Analytics-Internship/tree/main/Task%202-%20Data%20Insignts) I performed exploratory data analysis on the preprocessed data to derive meaningful insights. This involved identifying trends, patterns, and outliers, which contributed to making informed business decisions.

3. [**Data Insights and Presentation:**](https://github.com/Jakom001/Data-Analytics-Internship/tree/main/Task%203%20-%20Data%20Insignts%20and%20Presentation) I used visualization tools to present the insights obtained from the previous analysis. This project required effective communication of findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

4. [**Data Segmentation and Targeting:**]() I used clustering techniques to segment the data into distinct groups based on certain features. This segmentation aided in identifying target customer groups for marketing strategies.

5. [**Machine Learning Model:**]() In the final project, I built a predictive model using machine learning algorithms. The model was trained to predict the likelihood of a customer making a transaction, which could be used for customer engagement and retention strategies.

## Learnings
Throughout the internship, I gained several valuable insights and skills, including:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** I learned the importance of data quality and how to handle missing or erroneous data effectively.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** I honed my ability to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers in data, which is crucial for making data-driven decisions.

3. **Data Visualization:** I acquired skills in creating visualizations that effectively convey insights to different audiences, aiding in decision-making processes.

4. **Machine Learning:** I gained a foundational understanding of machine learning techniques and how they can be applied to real-world business problems.

5. **Business Context:** I learned how to approach data analytics projects within the context of real business challenges, aligning technical solutions with business objectives.

## Reflection
Participating in the KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship was an enriching experience that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, each contributing to a deeper understanding of data analytics and its applications in the business world. This internship has boosted my confidence in tackling complex analytical problems and has prepared me for a career in data analytics.
